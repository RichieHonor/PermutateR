Description: The functions contained in this package provide a method to perform a permutation test, 
    using the statistical model, and data supplied by the user. The permutation test involves
    randomly sampling one column from a data frame a specified amount of times, performing a model of 
    choice of over the data frame, and obtaining a distribution of test statistics from each model
    fitted over random data. There is also the functionality to optimize the simulation over all 
    available cores with a Macintosh computer.
